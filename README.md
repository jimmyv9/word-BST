# word-BST
Project for Data Structures and Algorithms where a Binary Search Tree (BST) is implemented.
The tree is built from words found in a text file, and is set to ignore any words found in the file "ignore.txt" provided inside the repository. The program then computes the amount of words in the text and their respective frequency.
